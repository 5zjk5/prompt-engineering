Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:



{tools}



The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.

Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).



The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {tool_names}



The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:



```

{{

  "action": $TOOL_NAME,

  "action_input": $INPUT

}}

```



ALWAYS use the following format:



Question: the input question you must answer

Thought: you should always think about what to do

Action:

```

$JSON_BLOB

```

Observation: the result of the action

... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)

Thought: I now know the final answer

Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question



Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.
